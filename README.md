Welcome Loreal Francis-Boyles,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **June 18, 2024**

## Introduction

The<sup>Happy</sup>Place is my first individual portfolio project that has been developed as part of the Code Insititues AI- Augmented Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. I put my skills to the test by using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap (v5.3) to create a static website based on youth mental health. 

The live project can be found here: <a href="https://lorealci.github.io/the-happy-place/" target="_blank"><u>The<sup>Happy</sup>Place</u></a>

## Project Outline

TheHappyPlace is a fictional organisation dedicated to help tackle mental health specifically in youths with a focus on peer ran support groups and self help tips. While the website is aimed directly at youths their is information for parents/guardians if they are worried about their child.
I made sure to fulfill content requirements and ensure the website runs smoothly across multiple devices while having a modern feel to attract youths to the site.

My key objectives were:
⦁	Responsive designs across all devices while meeting nessassry accessibility needs.
⦁	Use of bold 'happy' colours and appropriate imagery to catch my intended users attention.
⦁	A positive user experience based on the websites layout and navigation links.

## UX Design
## User Stories
I created these user stories using Co-pilot, i then defined them to meet my parameter and removed the ones that didnt fit my needs. I asked co-pilot: "Can you create 5 user stories for a static HTML and CSS website for youth mental health. Use the format "AS A ... I WANT TO ... SO I CAN ... The user needs are: relevant information , efficient communication, resources and support please?". I then refined my user stories to ensure it aligns with the scope of my project.

AS A young person I WANT TO access relevant information about mental health issues SO I CAN better understand my own mental health and seek appropriate help.

AS A concerned parent/ guardian I WANT TO find resources and advice on how to support someone struggling with mental health SO I CAN provide effective and compassionate support.

AS A young person I WANT TO have access to a list of local and online mental health resources SO I CAN find the help I need quickly and efficiently.

AS A young person I WANT TO read clear, empathetic, and non-judgmental content
SO I CAN feel understood and supported while learning about mental health.

AS A young person I WANT TO have a way to communicate efficiently with mental health professionals or support groups SO I CAN get timely advice and support.

AS A young person I WANT TO have a contact form SO I CAN reach out to mental health professionals or support services directly from the website.

AS A parent/guardian I WANT TO navigate the website quickly and without confusion
SO I CAN efficiently find the information I need without feeling overwhelmed.

## Colours
I spent some time refining my colour palette as its the one of the key components in a design process. After much research I wanted to choose brighter softer colours that captivates and welcomes my users. I chose light blue as my main colour as I closely relate that to a 'calming' colour. 

I searched for colour palettes with specific colours in mind - blue, yellow and pink -  which led me to www.colorpalettes.net. After i found the colour palette i thought was best i checked it against the colour contrast checker.

Main Palette:
⦁	Jet Stream #ADCDCB --light blue
⦁	Coral Pink #F88379 --pink
⦁	Wisteria Yellow #F7C815 --yellow
⦁	White #FFFFFF
⦁	Black #000000

## Fonts
Font was also a big consideration to ensure site users have a positive user experience while visiting the page. I used two sans-serif fonts Nunito and Dosis selected from google fonts(add link to site) using the direct import code at the top of my style.css file.
<strong>Dosis</strong> is used to primary font ensuring readability ease which adds to a postive user experience.
<strong>Nunito</strong> was used within logos, headings and sub-headings - this complements the primary font used.

## Wireframes
This low fideltiy wireframe was made using balsamiq to define the layouts key features to design a great user experience. Using  Bootstrap and available components allows for the construction of a page that feels familiar for easy navigation whilst also allowing for well structured content and a responsive design.

## Imagery
My image selection aided in the influence of the overall design in my website. With my site user in mind, i sought out images that would:
⦁	promote inclusivity 
⦁	be easily identifiable to the site users
⦁	relevance in my website

After seeking out many options of different style images i opted for clear, standout images that complement my site. Including images for young people of different backgrounds and ages. I used many different search terms to find the images i deemed appropriate these were:
⦁	mental health
⦁	teens mental health
⦁	laughing group of teens
⦁	sad teen
⦁	parent hugging teen

Before implementing the images into the project i used shortpixel.com to convert my images to a webp format to follow the current standards.

## Features
**general features** 
In order to fulfil the criteria the page consists of various amount of information in sections, with links, resources and other elements to contribute to a positive user experience.
Upon coding the site and implementing bootstrap the features and design changed a little bit from the original wireframe idea. I added title cover text on the hero image. This was done to make the flow of the page better and allow for more space for other content.

**Naviagtion and Hero Section**
I impletmented the navigation bar using bootstrap -  this allows for easy navigation around the site for best user experience. I added styling to the navigation bar  such as colours that show when a page is hovered over which aids in a good user experince as they can see clearly what they are clicking.

I chose to use a big bold image of happy young people for the hero section on the home page. This imagery links to what the site is about.

**Bootstrap Cards**
I opted to use bootstrap cards for links to the main content of the page, this allowed for a clean, clear and organised layout of the page. Within these cards i also provided links to additional information.

**Footer**
For the footer i used the same background colour as the navigation bar to distinguish it apart from the body of the page while also keeping the flow the same. I added a contact information section and social media links -  this helps provide a better user experince as it is simple and easy to understand.

## Responsive Design
Using bootstrap allowed for a site that is responsive with the need for too many media queries. The media queries added helped impletment a page that is fully responsive according to modern standards.

This has been a very valuable learning experience as i used Dev Tools in order to indentify and bugs revolving in the sites responsiveness. I have a much greater understanding in Bootstrap and how to adapt it using Dev Tools which will help me be better in future projects. 

## Deployment 
This GitHub project was created using the Code Insititue Template ensuring all necessary dependencies were included when opening within the designated workspace on VSCode.

I set up my repo using this method and template:

⦁	Login to my GitHub profile.
⦁	Navigate to the Code Institute Full Template
⦁	Clicked the dropdown for 'Use this template' and selected  "Create a new repository"
⦁	Input the name for your repo and clicked 'Create repository from template'
⦁	Navigated to the new repo and click the green 'Open' button with the Gitpod logo
⦁	I was now able to work on my repository within the VSCode workspace linked to my GitHub

Once the project repo is created, an early deployment for the live project should performed to allow for continous testing as the site could look different on the live site compared to the workspace browser.

Additional information on the delpoyemnt process can be found in the GitHub Docs.
