Welcome Loreal Francis-Boyles,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **June 18, 2024**

## Introduction

The<sup>Happy</sup>Place is my first individual portfolio project that has been developed as part of the Code Insititues AI- Augmented Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. I put my skills to the test by using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap (v5.3) to create a static website based on youth mental health. 

The live project can be found here: <a href="https://lorealci.github.io/the-happy-place/" target="_blank"><u>The<sup>Happy</sup>Place</u></a>

## Project Outline

TheHappyPlace is a fictional organisation dedicated to help tackle mental health specifically in youths with a focus on peer ran support groups and self help tips. While the website is aimed directly at youths their is information for parents/guardians if they are worried about their child.
I made sure to fulfill content requirements and ensure the website runs smoothly across multiple devices while having a modern feel to attract youths to the site.

My key objectives were:
⦁	Responsive designs across all devices while meeting nessassry accessibility needs.
⦁	Use of bold 'happy' colours and appropriate imagery to catch my intended users attention.
⦁	A positive user experience based on the websites layout and navigation links.

## UX Design
## User Stories
I created these user stories using Co-pilot, i then defined them to meet my parameter and removed the ones that didnt fit my needs. I asked co-pilot: "Can you create 5 user stories for a static HTML and CSS website for youth mental health. Use the format "AS A ... I WANT TO ... SO I CAN ... The user needs are: relevant information , efficient communication, resources and support please?". I then refined my user stories to ensure it aligns with the scope of my project.

AS A young person I WANT TO access relevant information about mental health issues SO I CAN better understand my own mental health and seek appropriate help.

AS A concerned parent/ guardian I WANT TO find resources and advice on how to support someone struggling with mental health SO I CAN provide effective and compassionate support.

AS A young person I WANT TO have access to a list of local and online mental health resources SO I CAN find the help I need quickly and efficiently.

AS A young person I WANT TO read clear, empathetic, and non-judgmental content
SO I CAN feel understood and supported while learning about mental health.

AS A young person I WANT TO have a way to communicate efficiently with mental health professionals or support groups SO I CAN get timely advice and support.

AS A young person I WANT TO have a contact form SO I CAN reach out to mental health professionals or support services directly from the website.

AS A parent/guardian I WANT TO navigate the website quickly and without confusion
SO I CAN efficiently find the information I need without feeling overwhelmed.
