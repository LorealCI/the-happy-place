Welcome Loreal Francis-Boyles,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **June 18, 2024**

## Introduction

The<sup>Happy</sup>Place is my first individual portfolio project that has been developed as part of the Code Insititues AI- Augmented Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. I put my skills to the test by using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap (v5.3) to create a static website based on youth mental health. 

The live project can be found here: <a href="https://lorealci.github.io/the-happy-place/" target="_blank"><u>The<sup>Happy</sup>Place</u></a>

## Project Outline

TheHappyPlace is a fictional organisation dedicated to help tackle mental health specifically in youths with a focus on peer ran support groups and self help tips. While the website is aimed directly at youths their is information for parents/guardians if they are worried about their child.
I made sure to fulfill content requirements and ensure the website runs smoothly across multiple devices while having a modern feel to attract youths to the site.

My key objectives were:
⦁	Responsive designs across all devices while meeting nessassry accessibility needs.
⦁	Use of bold 'happy' colours and appropriate imagery to catch my intended users attention.
⦁	A positive user experience based on the websites layout and navigation links.
